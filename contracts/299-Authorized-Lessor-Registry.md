# Issue #299: Security - Implement 'Authorized-Lessor-Registry' for Institutional Vesting

**Repository:** Lumina-etwork/Contracts  
**Focus Area:** Precision handling for linear vesting and smart contract security  
**Priority:** High  

## Overview

This issue addresses the need for a secure, institutional-grade authorization system for managing lessor identities in the vesting protocol. The Authorized-Lessor-Registry will provide a centralized yet secure mechanism for registering, verifying, and managing institutional lessors participating in the vesting ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

Current vesting contracts lack a robust mechanism for:
- Verifying institutional lessor identities
- Managing authorization levels for different types of lessors
- Providing audit trails for institutional participation
- Preventing unauthorized access to vesting schedules

## Proposed Solution

### Authorized-Lessor-Registry Contract

A dedicated registry contract that maintains:
- Verified institutional lessor profiles
- Authorization levels and permissions
- Historical records of lessor activities
- Multi-signature approval for new lessor registration

### Key Features

1. **Identity Verification**
   - KYC/AML compliance integration
   - Multi-factor authentication requirements
   - Institutional credential validation

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Different permission levels (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
   - Granular control over vesting operations
   - Time-bound authorization tokens

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Complete history of lessor activities
   - Immutable records on-chain
   - Event emissions for transparency

4. **Security Measures**
   - Multi-signature governance for critical operations
   - Rate limiting on sensitive operations
   - Emergency revocation capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Contract Structure

```solidity
contract AuthorizedLessorRegistry {
    struct LessorProfile {
        address lessorAddress;
        string institutionName;
        uint8 authorizationLevel;
        uint256 registrationDate;
        uint256 lastActiveDate;
        bool isActive;
        bytes32 credentialsHash;
    }
    
    mapping(address => LessorProfile) public lessors;
    mapping(address => uint8) public permissions;
    
    // Events
    event LessorRegistered(address indexed lessor, string institution, uint8 level);
    event LessorRevoked(address indexed lessor, string reason);
    event AuthorizationUpdated(address indexed lessor, uint8 oldLevel, uint8 newLevel);
}
```

### Integration Points

- VestingVault contract integration for authorization checks
- DAO governance for registry management
- External identity verification services

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1:** Only authorized lessors can create vesting schedules
2. **AC2:** Institutional identities are properly verified before registration
3. **AC3:** Complete audit trail is maintained for all lessor activities
4. **AC4:** Emergency revocation mechanisms function correctly
5. **AC5:** Multi-signature governance prevents single points of failure

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control:** Strict role-based permissions
- **Reentrancy Protection:** Guards against recursive calls
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive parameter checking
- **Upgrade Safety:** Secure contract upgrade mechanisms

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all authorization flows
- Integration tests with VestingVault
- Security audits for access control mechanisms
- Performance tests for high-volume operations

## Timeline

- **Phase 1:** Core registry contract development (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2:** Identity verification integration (1 week)
- **Phase 3:** Security audit and testing (1 week)
- **Phase 4:** Deployment and documentation (1 week)

## Dependencies

- VestingVault contract
- DAO governance framework
- External identity verification services
- Multi-signature wallet implementation
