# Zero-Knowledge Accredited Investor Verification

## Overview

This implementation addresses Issue #209 by integrating a ZK-Verifier function that enables privacy-preserving accredited investor verification. Instead of storing plain-text KYC status, the contract verifies a ZK-SNARK proof submitted by the user, mathematically proving they meet the jurisdictional requirements for "Accredited Investor" without revealing their country of origin or net worth.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ZK-SNARK Verifier**: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs for accredited investor status
2. **Nullifier System**: Prevents double-spending of accreditation proofs
3. **Verification Key Management**: Manages cryptographic keys for different circuits
4. **Accreditation Records**: Stores privacy-preserving accreditation status
5. **Jurisdiction Support**: Supports multiple jurisdictions with privacy preservation

### Key Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: Users prove accredited status without revealing sensitive financial information
- **Jurisdictional Privacy**: Country of origin is hashed and not revealed in plain text
- **Net Worth Privacy**: Actual net worth amounts are not stored on-chain
- **Double-Spending Prevention**: Nullifier system prevents proof reuse
- **Multi-Jurisdiction Support**: Supports different accredited investor criteria across jurisdictions
- **Expiry Management**: Accreditation proofs have configurable expiry times
- **Circuit Extensibility**: Architecture supports multiple verification circuits

## ZK-SNARK Circuit Design

### Accredited Investor Circuit

The ZK-SNARK circuit verifies the following conditions without revealing sensitive data:

1. **Jurisdictional Requirements**: Verifies user meets accredited investor criteria for their jurisdiction
2. **Net Worth Threshold**: Confirms net worth meets minimum requirements (amount not revealed)
3. **Income Threshold**: Confirms income meets minimum requirements (amount not revealed)
4. **Professional Certifications**: Verifies professional certifications if applicable
5. **Timestamp Validity**: Ensures proof is generated within valid timeframe

### Privacy-Preserving Public Inputs

- **jurisdiction_hash**: Hash of jurisdiction identifier (prevents country revelation)
- **net_worth_threshold_met**: Boolean indicating if threshold met (no amount revealed)
- **income_threshold_met**: Boolean indicating if threshold met (no amount revealed)
- **professional_certifications**: Boolean for certification status
- **timestamp**: Proof generation time
- **expiry**: When accreditation expires

### Private Witness Inputs

- **Actual net worth amount** (never revealed)
- **Actual income amount** (never revealed)
- **Country of origin** (never revealed, only hash used)
- **Professional certification details** (never revealed)
- **User secret** for proof generation

## Security Features

### Double-Spending Prevention
- Nullifier system ensures each proof can only be used once
- Nullifiers are permanently tracked after use
- Prevents accreditation proof reuse

### Cryptographic Security

```rust
// Only accredited investors can create these vaults
let vault_id = contract.create_vault_accredited_only(
    accredited_investor,
    1000000,  // 1M tokens
    token_address,
    start_time,
    end_time,
    keeper_fee,
    is_revocable,
    is_transferable,
    step_duration
);
